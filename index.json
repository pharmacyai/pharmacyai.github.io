This isn’t a new idea, but approach is where we hope to move the needle. Today, the Serbian educational and economic system doesn’t work – there is a lot of great talent in both domains which isn’t giving its full and meaningful potential. Pharmacy AI mission is to change this, by connecting students and experts and creating environment for both learning and research.\nToday we are starting simple: members and contributors are learning about both areas, building the platform, knowledge and community. We will be looking into research areas with publicly available datasets and opportunities to apply technology to help people in Serbia. The whole project and work will be shared on this website and corresponding GitHub project.\nIf above lines resonated with you, we hope that you will find some interesting content on these pages and consider contacting us for joining the Pharmacy AI efforts.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/pharmacy-ai/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/pharmacy-ai/","section":"authors","summary":"Pharmacy AI is a project grounded on a very simple vision: brining closer students and experts from pharmaceutical sciences and computer sciences in order to accelerate health care applied research in Serbia.","tags":null,"title":"Pharmacy AI","type":"authors"}]
