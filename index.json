This isn’t a new idea, but approach is where we hope to move the needle. Today, the Serbian educational and economic system doesn’t work – there is a lot of great talent in both domains which isn’t giving its full and meaningful potential. Pharmacy AI mission is to change this, by connecting students and experts and creating environment for both learning and research.\nToday we are starting simple: members and contributors are learning about both areas, building the platform, knowledge and community. We will be looking into research areas with publicly available datasets and opportunities to apply technology to help people in Serbia. The whole project and work will be shared on this website and corresponding GitHub project.\nIf above lines resonated with you, we hope that you will find some interesting content on these pages and consider contacting us for joining the Pharmacy AI efforts.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/author/pharmacy-ai/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/pharmacy-ai/","section":"authors","summary":"Pharmacy AI is a project grounded on a very simple vision: brining closer students and experts from pharmaceutical sciences and computer sciences in order to accelerate health care applied research in Serbia.","tags":null,"title":"Pharmacy AI","type":"authors"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"A drug interaction is a reaction between drug and other drugs, food, or supplements. These interactions may make drug less effective, cause unexpected side effects, or increase the action of a drug. On one side, combinations of drug therapies are showing promising results for several diseases, however on the other side drug interaction side effects can lead to adverse drug events (ADEs) or adverse drug reactions (ADRs).\nDrug-drug interactions (DDI) refers to the efficacy change of drug in case of co-administration with another drug. It is estimated that over 30% of all adverse drug reactions are due to drug interactions, [1, 2]. Due to complexity of this problem, it unfeasible to identify all potential DDIs using experimentational methods. We are also learning about a lot of interactions from clinical trials and post-marketing drug surveillance (PMS).\nTherefore, there is a pressure need, and huge opportunity, for advancements in computational methods for detecting DDIs. There are two main categories from which we can approach:\n classification methods: using various drug information detect potential DDI, drug pairs, during the drug development process or find new DDIs from existing set of drugs knowledge-based methods: from corpus of medical content (scientific literature, blogs, etc.) extract information about drug interaction  In this post, we will give quick high-level overview of classification method, and data sources from which we will start exploring the solution space. Before we dig in into a bit more technical conversations, here is a great TED talk by Russ Altman (an American professor of bioengineering, genetics, medicine, and biomedical data science and past chairman of the bioengineering department at Stanford University) about what happens when you mix medications.\n  Classification methods approch \rClassification represents a problem of identifying to which category, or set of categories, new object belongs. In case of DDI, we are looking at drug pairs and we want to predict if given pair of drugs will lead to adverse drug reaction. This is called binary classification problem because we have two classes. In case if we are interested in type of reaction, problem moves to be multiclass classification area but for purpose of this post let us consider only two classes: DDI and non-DDI.\nUsually, classification problem requires us to train a model, a function, which maps object to category (or probability for each of the possible categories). For us to find the optimal model parameters, we need dataset containing example objects for both classes. For example, creating a model for classification of profile images to male and female requires us to have a dataset with example profile images of both male and female.\n\rDDI classification approch: mapping two drugs into probability that they are DDI pair\r\r\rDDI is an example of a one-class classification problem. We have set of samples from one class, DDI in our case which we will call positive class, and unlabeled samples. For DDI, unlabeled samples represent all the drug pairs for which we do not have information that they might have interaction in case of coadministration. This means that we do not have information about instances from unlabeled dataset, they could be positive or negative. In order to apply classification approach, we need instances of both positive and negative classes. There are various techniques how can reliable negative samples be extracted from unlabeled dataset.\n\rOne-class classification DDI overview\r\r\rLet us look at the DrugBank [3], one of the online available drug data sources. Database contains various information about drugs, like chemical structure or drug targets, and for each drug it contains list of drugs with which there is an interaction. This is example of dataset we can use for training the DDI classification models.\nDrugs are complex objects, and in order to apply computational methods over them we need to represent them in vector form, as list of numbers. As noted, drug has multiple different properties, such as chemical structure, targets, indications, pathways, substituents etc. Each of the component tells us different drug property, but they are also correlated to an extent.\n\rExample of, arguably a bit odd, vector representation in $R^5$, vector of 5 numbers\r\r\rFor example, that a look at information about Acetaminophen (paracetamol) from DrugBank, where you can find most of the drug properties mentioned here. After having a drug representation in a vector form, we can create a drug pair representation in different ways, like concatenating these drug vectors or applying pairwise sum.\nIn the next post we will be looking at different ways to represent drug in vector form.\nReferences [1] Zheng Y, Peng H, Zhang X, Zhao Z, Gao X, Li J, DDI-PULearn: a positive-unlabeled learning method for large-scale prediction of drug-drug interactions, BMC Bioinformatics. 2019;20(19):661 https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-3214-6\n[2] Bucşa C, Farcas A, Cazacu I, Daniel-Corneliu L, Achimas A, Mogosan C, Bojita M, How many potential drug-drug interactions cause adverse drug reactions in hospitalized patients?, European journal of internal medicine. 2012; 24. 10.1016 https://www.ejinme.com/article/S0953-6205(12)00249-X/pdf\n[3] Wishart DS, Feunang YD, Guo AC, Lo EJ, Marcu A, Grant JR, Sajed T, Johnson D, Li C, Sayeeda Z, Assempour N, Iynkkaran I, Liu Y, Maciejewski A, Gale N, Wilson A, Chin L, Cummings R, Le D, Pon A, Knox C, Wilson M.
